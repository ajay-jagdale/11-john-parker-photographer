              Hello! I'm John Parker, a passionate photographer with a love for capturing the fleeting moments that tell a larger story. My journey began over a decade ago with a simple film camera, and since then, I've been obsessed with light, composition, and emotion.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Whether I'm hiking through remote landscapes to catch the perfect sunrise or navigating bustling city streets to find hidden narratives, my goal is always the same: to create images that are not only beautiful but also deeply resonant.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that a great photograph is one that you can feel. Itâ€™s an honor to share my perspective with you.
